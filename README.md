# **MixMuse**

## **Description**

This MERN full stack e-commerce web application is built with React and the open source JavaScript library Redux, which remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application. 

MixMuse is a scalable, user-focused MERN app that offers a wide range of bartending supplies such as liquor, equipment and mixers. Age verification is required to enter the site. The app leverages Redux's powerful capabilities to handle global state, ensuring a seamless shopping experience. The Redux store orchestrates data flow, while a Redux provider grants access to this central state. This architecture enables precise control over state changes and data extraction, ensuring that actions are dispatched effectively throughout the app.
